          What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I would like to work full-time as a developer, preferably working
          remotely from my home office. I am flexible around whether my next dev
          job is full-stack, front-end or back-end. I would prefer to work
          primarily with JavaScript-based technologies like vanilla JS,
          TypeScript, React, Angular and Node as they have been my main focus
          for the last while. But, if a great opportunity in WordPress
          development came up, I would be interested in that too. (My earlier
          experience was with WordPress development.)

          The most valuable skills for me to develop in this learning context
          are the skills related to working as part of a dev team in an Agile

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Participating effectively in Agile ceremonies</li>
          <li>
            Giving and receiving feedback on things like code and design ideas
          </li>
          <li>Improving team dynamics, practices and/or workflows</li>
          <li>
            Influencing/making suggestions to the team or a team member when I'm
            not in charge – without upsetting them (or stepping on the toes of
            the team lead if there is one)

        <p>I will manage myself to work productively with the team by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Always being on time and prepared for meetings</li>

            Using time management tools and techniques including a calendar,

          <li>Removing distractions from my environment</li>

          <li>Communicating with others kindly and empathetically</li>
          <li>Asking for help if I need it</li>
          <li>
            Not taking on any other commitments so that nothing else is
            competing with bootcamp for time and attention

          <li>
            Taking especially good care of myself (see below) so that I am
            always in the best possible frame of mind to deal with anything that
            might come up

          What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to
          you
        </h2>
        <p>
          During bootcamp, I will do my best to ensure that things don't
          overwhelm me by increasing my resilience. I will do this by taking
          especially good care of myself including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Getting enough sleep</li>
          <li>Eating well</li>
          <li>Exercising</li>
          <li>
            Practising some form of Non Sleep Deep Relaxation (NSDR) like yoga
            nidra or other mindfulness techniques
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If things start to get to me, I'll do one or more of the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Talk with a friend</li>
          <li>Go for a walk</li>
          <li>Use breathing techniques to regain calm</li>
          <li>De-stress by listening to some music</li>
          <li>Do some extra NSDR</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 class="eda-prompt">
          A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </h2>
        <p>
          If I am getting overwhelmed, I will talk to my facilitator about it.
          If there were any extenuating circumstances that prevented me from
          meeting a team commitment, I would contact my team ASAP to let them
          know and work out how to proceed.

      <section>
        <h2 class="eda-prompt">
          A description of what you expect from the facilitation team
        </h2>
        <p>
          The types of input from the facilitation team that I think would be
          most useful to me are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Code review</li>
          <li>
            Feedback on how I can:
            <ul>
              <li>Improve how I work as part of a dev team</li>
              <li>Paricipate in Agile ceremonies better</li>
              <li>Give and receive feedback on code better</li>
              <li>
                Improve any other skills that my future employers will likely
                expect with regard to working as part of an Agile dev team.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Providing an example to follow e.g. when one of the EDA staff takes
            the role of lead dev on the cohort project
          </li>
          <li>
            Helping or showing our teams how organise ourselves/run our projects
            in the way that a good professional dev team would
          </li>
          <li>
            Letting me know as early as possible if I am not meeting
            expectations or need to re-do any work
          </li>
