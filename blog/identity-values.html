        <h2 class="eda-prompt">Describe your core personal values.</h2>

        <p>
          Some of my core personal values include kindness, honesty, integrity,
          empathy, compassion, treating others with respect and consideration,
          inclusivity, celebrating diversity, cooperation, fairness and acting
          in ways that make things better in the world better rather the worse.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="eda-prompt">
          Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.
        </h2>
        <p>
          My values and identity have been influenced by many cultures. I have
          had the immense privilege of having lived in a few different countries
          and having worked in an organisation with people of 40+ different
          nationalities. I noticed that living within and experiencing other
          cultures changed aspects of my own values, identity, habits and world
          view.
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe the culture(s) you grow up in have an especially strong
          influence on your values and identity. I grew up in an area where the
          cultures to which I was mostly exposed were Pākeha, Māori and Pasifika
          cultures. But, because as a child and teenager that was all I knew, I
          didn't really recognise what was around me as "culture(s)". It was
          just "how things are".
        </p>

        <p>
          You may have heard the analogy of a fish not being able to see water
          used as a metaphor for how we often fail to notice our own culture. I
          think the comparison is apt. It wasn't until in my early twenties,
          when I left Aotearoa to live overseas for the first time, that I
          really started to notice that I even had "a culture". In other
          countries, I experienced different notions of "right and wrong" and
          the "normal" way of doing things. The contrast of those differences
          began to define for me the contours of what "my culture" was.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through these experiences I learned and adopted some things that I
          thought were done "better" in other cultures than my own. I also
          learned other ways of thinking about things or behaving that were
          neither better nor worse, just different. That taught me cultural
          flexibility, where I adapt to one way of doing things within one
          culture, but do things differently in another. However, there are some
          values that are so much a part of my identity that they never change
          no matter what cultural context I am in. Maybe that is because they
          are such important parts of the family culture I grew up in. These
          include things like the utmost importance of treating all people as
          equally worthy humans and equal citizens, not discriminating against
          them based on things like their gender, sexual orientation, race or
          religion. It is good to adapt and be flexible, but not to the
          detriment of others.

        <h2 class="eda-prompt">
          Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.
          Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and
          career development. Identify which of your strengths might help you in
          your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning
          obstacles.
        </h2>
        <p>
          I was very fortunate to have a mother who instilled in me, from a very
          young age, the belief that I could learn anything I wanted as long as
          I put in the effort. I became a confident life-long independent
          learner. Other strengths I have that might help my learning and career
          development are excellent verbal and written communication skills,
          being multi-lingual and having a high degree of cross-cultural
          awareness. I work well both autonomously and collaboratively with a
          team. I am trustworthy, reliable, conscientious, highly motivated and
          disciplined and have good attention to detail. I am creative,
          naturally curious, have good problem solving skills, and love
          learning. I am also good at teaching/training others.
        </p>

        <p>
          Time boxing is important because the downside of being
          conscientiousness and attentive to detail is the possibility of
          spending too long on something, getting it just right. Similarly, the
          downside of curiosity can be getting led off on interesting
          technological tangents. Prioritising focus, just-in-time learning and
          time-management techniques are important for preventing this in the
          context of this bootcamp.
