          What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning
          and programming?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Values, empathy and self awareness are important for both learning and
          programming because they increase your capacity to learn and are
          crucial for being a good team member. Most programming jobs/projects
          involve lots of teamwork. If you are self aware, you'll know your
          interpersonal weaknesses and your emotional triggers. And, if you know
          them, then you can start to manage them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Knowing your values and understanding that other people's
          prioritisation of different values may differ from yours helps you
          understand where others are coming from and interact with them
          appropriately – treating them with kindness, dignity and respect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having empathy allows you to care enough to do the things mentioned
          above. It also helps you be aware of what others may be feeling, and
          how your group is reacting emotionally to your actions and behaviour.
          If everybody in a team as empathy and self awareness, that team will
          be able to work really well together and have a very positive
          experience.
        </p>
        <p>For learning in a group context all of these same points apply.</p>
        <p>
          If you are learning on your own, empathy will be less important than
          when working with others, but knowing your values and self awareness
          are both still essential. Knowing your values will help you remember
          why you are learning, and self awareness will help you manage yourself
          to learn well.

          What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I was surprised to find that I already had a good knowledge of the
          topics covered in Foundations Core. The core content happened to
          coincide with prior learning I had done over the years as a result of
          my general interest in these topics and my learning and experience as
          a teacher. (I had already either self-studied the topics or studied
          them through professional development sessions in my previous job as a
          teacher.)

          What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I am a private person. Having to share very personal thoughts online
          in a public blog was uncomfortable.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="eda-prompt">
          Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much
          time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Core learning and human skills are immensely important for
          programmers. You need to be able to "think like a web developer" –
          knowing how to problem solve and be somewhat independent in doing so –
          so that you are not constantly bothering your senior dev or other
          colleagues with questions about how to solve a problem if it is
          something you should be able to work out for yourself by looking at
          the organisation's wiki or Googling it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Self awareness and empathy are crucial for working well in teams which
          is a big part of being a dev.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding neuroplasticity and having a growth mindset can help you
          learn more efficiently and effectively, which is especially important
          given how much we are going to cover in a short period oof time in
          Bootcamp.
        </p>
        <p>
          Creating a Learning Plan forces students to think about the kinds of
          obstacles they will face during Bootcamp and plan strategies to be
          more resilient and overcome them.

        <h2 class="eda-prompt">
          Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste
          of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
          instead? Justify your answer.
        </h2>
        <p>
          I think whether or not studying the <em>theory</em> behind core/human
          skills (as opposed to putting it into <em>practice</em>) will have
          been useful will vary hugely from student to student. If the concepts
          covered were new for a student, then what we have done so far in
          Foundations will have been very useful for them. If they were already
          very familiar with the theory we covered, it may not have been.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to my prior experience, none of the theory covered in Foundations
          was new for me. However, while in Foundations a lot of the core
          learning was <em>theory</em>, I believe in Bootcamp we will get plenty
          of opportunity to put it all into <em>practice</em>. My experience as
          a teacher (and learner) has taught me that "knowing" something and
          being able to actually "do" it are two completely different things.
          While I already "knew" the material covered in the Foundations core
          learning, I think "doing" these things in Bootcamp will be a useful
          experience for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, I think for me personally, the valuable part of the core
          learning/human skills will come in Bootcamp – putting all these
          concepts into practice in the specific context of us all working
          together in dev teams and under considerable pressure. In fact, that
          is the main reason I enrolled in Dev Academy – to get practice working
          as part of a dev team, practising the relevant human skills as much as
          possible while doing so.
