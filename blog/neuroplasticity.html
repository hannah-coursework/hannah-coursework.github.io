          Discuss your understanding about neuroplasticity and growth mindset
          and how they influence your learning
        </h2>
        <p>
          The topic of neuroplasticity is a fascinating one. One of the most
          engaging and informative sources on this topic that I have found is
          Dr. Andrew Huberman, a Stanford University Associate Professor of
          Neurobiology and Ophthalmology and the Laboratory Director at
          Stanford's Huberman Lab. In the two videos below Dr. Huberman
          discusses neuroplasticity and learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neuroplasticity is how our brain (and nervous system) learns and
          acquires new capabilities. It is our brain and nervous system's
          ability to change itself. For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>fear of a place or thing in response to traumatic event</li>
          <li>positive response to a powerful happy experience</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity can benefit people by
          helping them learn better. According to Dr. Huberman, awareness of
          this is especially important after the age of about 25.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Huberman explains that early in development your nervous system is
          connected very broadly in ways that make it hard to do anything well.
          From birth until about age 25, those connections get refined, mainly
          through the removal of connections that don't serve us, and through
          the incredible strengthening of connections that relate to either
          powerful experiences or that allow us to do things like walk and talk
          and do math, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under 25s can learn through almost passive experience – they don't
          need to focus much to learn new things. They go from no language to
          being able to speak many words and sentences including words they've
          never heard before. The regions of the brain involved in speech and
          languages are primed to learn and create new combinations.
        </p>
        <p>
          After age 25, if we want to change these connections, we have to
          engage in some very specific processes, which are gated, meaning you
          can't just decide to change your brain. You actually have to go
          through a series of steps to change your internal state in ways that
          will allow you to change your brain.
        </p>
        <p>
          In under 25s, there is a lot of space between the neurons and
          chemicals "sloshing around" that make it more plastic. Whereas over
          25, the extra-cellular space is filled up by the extra-cellular matrix
          (ECM) and the glial cells, like pouring concrete between rocks, making
          change in connections harder.
        </p>
        <p>
          For over 25s, the first step in neural plasticity is recognising that
          you want to change something. You have to be deliberate and know
          exactly what it is that YouTube want to change or at least know that
          you want to change something about some specific experience. You
          should call it to your consciousness. Be it a cognitive, emotional or
          motor skill, first recognise what that thing is. The brain has
          self-recognition mechanisms – they are neurochemicals. Neurochemicals
          stamp down particular behaviours and thoughts and emotional patterns
          and tell the rest of the nervous system, this is something to pay
          attention to because this is in the direction of the change that I
          want to make. There are specific chemicals that when we are
          consciously aware of a change we want to make.
          <strong
            >The trigger for plasticity occurs during high focus, high alertness
            states (both alertness and focus are required for the right
            neurochemcials)</strong
          >.

          The videos are long, but the content is fascinating and worth a watch.

        <h2 class="eda-prompt">Growth Mindset</h2>
        <p>
          Growth Mindset is the work of Dr. Carol Dweck. It compares fixed
          mindsets to growth mindsets. A fixed mindset is the belief that you
          are born with your abilities and a growth mindset is the belief that
          you can learn any abilities through effort.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is some debate about Dr. Dweck's research and its critics say it
          can be difficult to replicate. Regardless, it seems to stand as common
          sense that a growth mindset will be better for learning. This is
          because if I have no confidence in my ability to improve, I won't try
          hard, and as a consequence, I won't rise to the full level of my
          potential (whether that potential is fixed or not).
        </p>
        <p>
          The resource on this topic that I found most interesting was the
          original book by Carol Dweck
          <em>Mindset: The New Psychology of Success</em>, which I read some
          years ago.
